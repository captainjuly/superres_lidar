@article{medical,
	Abstract = {This paper provides an overview on super-resolution ({SR}) research in medical imaging applications. Many imaging modalities exist. Some provide anatomical information and reveal information about the structure of the human body, and others provide functional information, locations of activity for specific activities and specified tasks. Each imaging system has a characteristic resolution, which is determined based on physical constraints of the system detectors that are in turn tuned to signal-to-noise and timing considerations. A common goal across systems is to increase the resolution, and as much as possible achieve true isotropic 3-D imaging. {SR} technology can serve to advance this goal. Research on {SR} in key medical imaging modalities, including {MRI}, {fMRI} and {PET}, has started to emerge in recent years and is reviewed herein. The algorithms used are mostly based on standard {SR} algorithms. Results demonstrate the potential in introducing {SR} techniques into practical medical applications.},

@article{microscopy,
	Abstract = {We introduce a method for optically imaging intracellular proteins at nanometer spatial resolution. Numerous sparse subsets of photoactivatable fluorescent protein molecules were activated, localized (to âˆ¼2 to 25 nanometers), and then bleached. The aggregate position information from all subsets was then assembled into a superresolution image. We used this method---termed photoactivated localization microscopy---to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria; in fixed whole cells, we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions, actin within a lamellipodium, and the distribution of the retroviral protein Gag at the plasma membrane.
Proteins of interest can be labeled with fluorescent tags and located by photoactivated localization microscopy ({PALM}) in thin sections and fixed cells at near-molecular resolution.
